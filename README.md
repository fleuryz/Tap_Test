A simple Taxi Fare Calculator
This project was created on Visual Studio 2019 using .Net Windows Forms and is only compatible with Microsoft Windows.

Drivers are added one by one through the "Add Driver" button.
Fare information is added through a loaded CSV file in which each fare has the format "{Distance Traveled},{Traveled Unit},{Cost Per Distance Traveled}",
in which one fare information is added by line from the CSV. Each fare can have its final cost calculated.

The final price is calculated after selecting a fare and a driver or selecting the "Best" value for the driver, in which the cheapest fare value will be found.
